* Placing an [air temperature thermometer](https://www.amazon.com/Antonki-Hygrometer-Humidity-Thermometer-Greenhouse/dp/B07Z77FK4C/ref=sr_1_4) inside the dehyrdator will help you adjust the temperature according. Some dehydrators may fluctuate in temperature from their control mechanism.

    * placing in direct sunlight
    * warming by the light inside the oven
    * slightly warmed pot of water
